# RandomScripts

This is a collection of random scripts I use in my research.

Perhaps some day some of them might end up in a package, but meh.

I intend each to be stand-alone, and each should contain comments sufficient to describe its usage. (This is a note-to-self as much as anything).

Editing to test some git features. Please ignore.
